		I'm a software developer originally from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, now residing in Karlsruhe, Germany.
		With a strong educational background in Business Informatics from the Karlsruhe University of
		Applied Sciences (HKA), I currently work at <a href="https://dscsag.com">DSC Software AG</a> as
		a <em>"Developer | Product Manager"</em>, where I combine my technical expertise with my passion
		for building exceptional software solutions.

		My areas of focus lie primarily in web and mobile development, with a special interest in edge
		devices and the exciting world of IoT. Alongside my development skills, I also possess valuable
		experience as a translator and editor, gained through my involvement with AAA video games and
		mobile applications as a volunteer before and during university.

		Automation and continuous delivery are two of my key passions. I firmly believe in streamlining
		processes and harnessing the power of automation to achieve efficiency and superior results.
